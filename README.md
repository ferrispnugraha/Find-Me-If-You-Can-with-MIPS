# Find-Me-If-You-Can-with-MIPS

By Using MARS as IDE for MIPS Assembly Language, created this simple software to implement the game.

In this project, we have a 10x10 treasure field (with coordinate (0,0) until (9,9)).\
Player inputs 5 digit number as a seed to generate coordinate of treasure, (tx, ty).

After the player inputs the x coordinate and then the y coordinate, the program display messages showing whether the x coordinate is larger than, smaller than or equal to tx,
and whether the y coordinate is larger than, smaller than or equal to ty. 

The game will not end until the player guesses (tx, ty) correctly. 
If the player makes a correct guess, the program will ask the player to exit or not. 
If the player would like to play again, the program will generate a new coordinate for the treasure.
